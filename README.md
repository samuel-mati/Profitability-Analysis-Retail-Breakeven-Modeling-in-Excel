# Profitability Analysis: Retail Breakeven Modeling in Excel

## Executive Summary
This project provides a **Prescriptive Financial Analysis** framework for a small retail business owner (Mr. Tom Miller) struggling with intermittent losses (**Net Margin Erosion**).

The Solution: Using **Goal Seek** modeling in Excel, the analysis diagnoses the root cause of the loss in the worst-performing month and provides a quantifiable, immediate mandate for corrective action.

The key output is the exact dollar amount needed for a **Cost Base Reduction** or **Revenue Uplift** to restore the business to a **Breakeven Point** (`Net Profit of $0`), converting financial ambiguity into a clear business target.


## 3. The Business Problem

**Context and Pain Point:**
The business suffers from a lack of financial visibility due to fragmented data (separate files for sales, expenses, and inventory). This prevents the owner from pinpointing the source of losses and reacting quickly to negative trends. The current reliance on checking the bank balance provides only a lagging indicator of financial health.

**The Specific Business Question (The Mandate):**

`"For the month exhibiting the largest loss (maximum Net Margin Erosion), what is the minimum required adjustment—either a specific dollar amount of Cost Base Reduction or a percentage increase in Revenue Uplift—needed to restore the business to a financial Breakeven Point, thereby providing a clear, high-priority mandate for immediate intervention?"
